# Mappool Details Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the mappool system to fetch and display detailed beatmap information including names, difficulty names, and map statistics.

## New Features Added

### 1. Detailed Beatmap Information Storage
- **Title**: Song title from beatmapset
- **Artist**: Song artist from beatmapset  
- **Difficulty Name**: Version name (e.g., "Insane", "Expert")
- **Mapper**: Creator of the beatmapset
- **Length**: Duration in seconds
- **BPM**: Beats per minute
- **CS**: Circle Size (0-10)
- **OD**: Overall Difficulty (0-10) 
- **AR**: Approach Rate (0-10)
- **HP**: HP Drain Rate (0-10)
- **Star Rating**: Difficulty rating (stars)
- **URL**: Direct link to beatmap page

### 2. Backend Changes (`app/routes/player_routes.py`)

#### Enhanced `upload_mappool()` function:
- Fetches detailed beatmap data via `api.beatmap(beatmap_id)` for each map
- Stores complete map details in `mappool_details` array
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `mappool_ids`
- Includes robust error handling with fallback data
- Provides warning messages for failed API calls

#### Enhanced `match_interface()` route:
- Passes `player_mappool_details` and `opponent_mappool_details` to template
- Maintains compatibility with old ID-only system

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### Player Profile Template (`app/templates/player_profile.html`):
- New detailed mappool display section showing:
  - Song title, artist, and difficulty name
  - Star rating prominently displayed
  - Map statistics in organized grid (Length, BPM, CS, AR, OD, HP)
  - Direct links to beatmap pages
  - Hover effects and responsive design

#### Match Interface Template (`app/templates/match_interface.html`):
- Enhanced map cards with:
  - Full song information display
  - Star rating indicator
  - Key statistics (Length, BPM, AR, OD) in compact grid
  - Better visual hierarchy and spacing
  - Fallback to ID-only display if details unavailable

### 4. Data Structure

#### New `mappool_details` format:
```json
{
  "id": 2345678,
  "title": "Song Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name", 
  "difficulty_name": "Insane",
  "mapper": "Mapper Name",
  "length": 180,
  "bpm": 150.0,
  "cs": 4.0,
  "od": 8.5,
  "ar": 9.0,
  "hp": 6.0,
  "star_rating": 5.23,
  "url": "https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1234567#osu/2345678"
}
```

### 5. Error Handling & Fallbacks

#### Robust Error Handling:
- Individual map API failures don't break entire upload
- Warning messages for partial failures
- Fallback data structure for unavailable maps
- Graceful degradation to ID-only display

#### Fallback Data:
- "Unknown Title/Artist/Difficulty/Mapper" for missing info
- Zero values for unavailable statistics
- Basic beatmap URL construction

### 6. Visual Enhancements

#### Player Profile:
- Organized grid layout for map statistics
- Color-coded sections (green for uploaded, blue for details)
- Star ratings with yellow highlighting
- Responsive 2-column grid for large screens

#### Match Interface:
- Compact 4-column statistics grid
- Time formatting (MM:SS)
- Color-coded map pools (blue for player, yellow for opponent)
- Consistent typography and spacing

### 7. Backward Compatibility

- All existing `mappool_ids` and `mappool_url` functionality preserved
- Templates check for multiple data sources (URL, IDs, or details)
- Graceful fallback to simpler display when detailed data unavailable
- No breaking changes to existing tournament data

### 8. Performance Considerations

- API calls are made during upload (not real-time)
- Detailed data cached in tournament data structure
- Error handling prevents API failures from breaking uploads
- Batch processing of multiple beatmap requests

## Usage

1. **Upload mappool** - System automatically fetches detailed info
2. **View profile** - See beautiful detailed mappool display
3. **Match interface** - Rich map information for better pick/ban decisions
4. **Error resilience** - Partial failures handled gracefully

The enhanced system provides much better user experience while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing data.
